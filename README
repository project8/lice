this is a library to access the slow control data
look at getP8Sensor.cc for an example of how to use it

note, requires libcurl to compile

also, memstream in CouchDBInterface may not work on OSX.  I suggest someone with a mac look up how to fix this, and do so in a way where it can work for everyone
